Coach: Welcome back! How have you been doing since our last session?

Client: Well, it's been a bit of a mixed bag to be honest. Work has been incredibly stressful lately. My team is facing tight deadlines on the Anderson project, and I feel like I'm always falling behind.

Coach: That sounds challenging. How is that impacting you?

Client: I've been feeling really anxious, especially in the mornings. I wake up with this knot in my stomach, worrying about all the tasks I need to complete. And sometimes I wonder if I'm actually capable of doing this job well.

Coach: It sounds like you're experiencing significant anxiety related to work performance.

Client: Yes, definitely. And I know it's affecting my home life too. I'm irritable with my partner and I've been skipping my evening walks because I feel like I should be working instead.

Coach: How does that make you feel, when you skip those activities that normally help you recharge?

Client: Frustrated and disappointed in myself. I know self-care is important, but there's this voice that keeps saying "You don't deserve a break when your work isn't done." It's like I need to earn relaxation.

Coach: That's an interesting belief - that relaxation must be earned. Has that thought pattern been with you for a long time?

Client: I guess it has. Growing up, my parents always emphasized hard work. They'd say things like "leisure comes after all your responsibilities are met." They meant well, but I think I internalized this idea that taking breaks is somehow lazy or indulgent.

Coach: How is that belief serving you now?

Client: It's not serving me at all. I'm exhausted, irritable, and probably less productive because I'm not giving myself time to recharge. But it's so hard to shake that feeling of guilt when I try to relax.

Coach: What would it look like to challenge that belief?

Client: I suppose I could try to schedule small breaks even when I'm busy. Maybe start with just 15 minutes of walking outside during lunch? And remind myself that rest actually helps me be more productive and creative.

Coach: That sounds like a great start. What else might help you manage the work stress?

Client: I think I need to be more realistic about what I can accomplish in a day. Maybe make a priority list each morning instead of trying to do everything at once. And I should probably talk to my manager about the workload - I've been avoiding that conversation.

Coach: These are excellent strategies. I'm hearing specific action steps: taking short breaks, prioritizing tasks, and having that conversation with your manager. Which one feels most important to begin with?

Client: Talking to my manager is probably the most important, but also the scariest. I worry she'll think I'm not capable if I say I'm struggling.

Coach: That's a valid concern. What makes you think she might react that way?

Client: Well, she always seems so put together and efficient. I don't want to disappoint her or seem like I can't handle challenges.

Coach: I wonder if there's a way to approach the conversation that feels comfortable while still addressing your needs?

Client: Maybe I could frame it as wanting to ensure I'm focusing on the right priorities rather than saying I can't handle the workload. That feels less vulnerable but still addresses the issue.

Coach: That's a thoughtful approach. When do you think you might have this conversation?

Client: I have a one-on-one scheduled with her on Thursday. I'll prepare what I want to say beforehand so I don't get flustered.

Coach: Excellent. And what about those small breaks we discussed?

Client: I'm going to start tomorrow. Even just 10 minutes outside at lunch, no matter how busy I am. And I'll try not to feel guilty about it.

Coach: That's a powerful commitment. How will you remind yourself of why this is important when that guilt creeps in?

Client: I'll remind myself that rest makes me more effective, not less. It's not lazy - it's necessary for sustainable performance. Maybe I can put a small note on my desk with that reminder.

Coach: I really like that. Before we end today, let's summarize what you're taking away from this session.

Client: I'm going to speak with my manager on Thursday about priorities, start taking short breaks beginning tomorrow even when busy, and work on challenging my belief that rest must be earned. I need to remember that taking care of myself actually helps me perform better.

Coach: Those are excellent takeaways. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?

Client: More hopeful and a bit calmer. Having a plan always helps me feel more in control. I still have anxiety about work, but I feel like I have some specific steps to try.

Coach: That's great progress. For next time, would you be willing to notice when that belief about "earning rest" comes up, and perhaps journal about it?

Client: Yes, I can do that. I'll try to catch it in the moment and write down what triggers it.

Coach: Wonderful. I look forward to hearing how these strategies work for you.
